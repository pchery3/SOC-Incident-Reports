# Incident Summary: Suspicious Network Traffic & Malware Indicators

## Incident ID
INC-003

## Incident Type
Network Traffic Analysis / Malware Investigation

## Detection Source
Packet Capture Analysis (Wireshark)

## Alert Overview
Suspicious network traffic was identified during packet analysis exercises. The traffic exhibited patterns consistent with potential malware activity, including abnormal connections, unusual protocol usage, and indicators commonly associated with command-and-control (C2) communication.

## Affected System
- **Host Type:** Endpoint workstation (lab environment)
- **Operating Context:** Simulated enterprise traffic

## Timeline
- **Traffic Captured:** During packet analysis lab session
- **Analysis Conducted:** Same session
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Verdict:** Suspicious / Potentially Malicious

## Network Traffic Details
- **Tool Used:** Wireshark
- **Protocols Observed:** TCP, HTTP, DNS
- **Notable Observations:**
  - Repeated outbound connections to unfamiliar IP addresses
  - Abnormal request patterns inconsistent with normal user behavior
  - Encoded or suspicious payload data
  - Irregular DNS queries potentially indicating beaconing behavior

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Unrecognized external IP addresses
- Suspicious DNS request frequency
- Payload structures inconsistent with standard application traffic
- Traffic patterns suggestive of automated communication

## Investigation Steps
- Captured and reviewed network packets using Wireshark
- Applied protocol and display filters to isolate suspicious traffic
- Analyzed TCP streams and request/response behavior
- Reviewed DNS queries and destination IP characteristics
- Correlated packet behavior with known malware communication techniques

## Findings
- Traffic characteristics aligned with potential malware beaconing behavior
- Network patterns were inconsistent with legitimate application activity
- Indicators suggested possible command-and-control communication
- No evidence of data exfiltration was observed during analysis

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- **TA0011 – Command and Control**
- **T1071 – Application Layer Protocol**
- **T1046 – Network Service Discovery**

## Severity Assessment
**Medium**  
The activity showed multiple indicators of suspicious behavior but lacked direct confirmation of host compromise or data exfiltration.

## Response Actions
- Flagged traffic as suspicious for further investigation
- Recommended monitoring or blocking identified IPs and domains
- Suggested endpoint inspection for potential malware presence
- Documented findings for SOC escalation or incident response review

## Outcome
Suspicious network traffic was successfully identified and analyzed using packet capture techniques. Findings were documented according to SOC procedures, and response recommendations were provided to reduce potential risk.

## Lessons Learned
- Packet analysis provides critical visibility beyond SIEM alerts
- Malware often communicates using subtle, repetitive traffic patterns
- Understanding baseline network behavior is essential for SOC analysts
- Network telemetry strengthens overall detection and response capabilities
